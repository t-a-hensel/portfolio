Hey there!

Here's a bit more context about what I've been doing so far.

Currently, I work on novel imaging methods, especially super-resolution microscopy of sub-diffraction scale dynamics. I know, its a mouthful - have a look at my recent publications to get a broader view of what we're doing.

Beyond that, I am interested in quantum metrology and applied quantum information. I am particularly fascinated by how quantum mechanical properties influence the extraction, communication, and processing of information.

In addition to my work in physics, I have a strong interest in philosophy. Studying the philosophy of science has broadened my perspective, allowing me to explore the intersections between science and its socio-political context.

That is why I hold graduate degrees in Physics and in Philosophy of Science from the University of Hannover. During my studies, I spent time at CERN, Stanford University, and Universitetet i Agder (Norway). I can highly recommend to explore different academic environments during your studies if you get the chance!
