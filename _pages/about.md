Hey, I’m Thomas, and you found my academic portfolio.

I pursue a PhD in physics at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de) in Göttingen and at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en). As a member of [Stefan Hell's](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de/hell) group, I focus on developing innovative methods for sub-diffraction scale microscopy.

I hold graduate degrees in Physics and in Philosophy of Science from the University of Hannover. During my studies, I spent time at CERN, Stanford University, and Universitetet i Agder (Norway).

Currently, I work on novel imaging methods, especially super-resolution microscopy of sub-diffraction scale dynamics. I know, its a mouthful - have a look at my recent publications to get a broader view of what we're doing.

Beyond that, I am interested in quantum metrology and applied quantum information. I am particularly fascinated by how quantum mechanical properties influence the extraction, communication, and processing of information.

In addition to my work in physics, I have a strong interest in philosophy. Studying the philosophy of science has broadened my perspective, allowing me to explore the intersections between science and its socio-political context.

Feel free to explore my site and learn more about my work and interests.
