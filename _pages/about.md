I’m Thomas, a passionate learner and researcher. You've found my academic portfolio, where you can explore my research interests.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in physics at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de) in Göttingen and [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en). As a member of [Stefan Hell's](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de/hell) group, I focus on developing innovative methods for sub-diffraction scale microscopy.

I hold graduate degrees in Physics and in Philosophy of Science from Hannover, and I have had the privilege of studying at University of Hanover, CERN, Stanford University, and Universitetet i Agder.

My primary research interests lie in novel imaging methods, quantum metrology, and applied quantum information. I am particularly fascinated by how quantum mechanical properties influence the extraction, communication, and processing of information.

In addition to my work in physics, I have a strong interest in philosophy. Studying the philosophy of science has broadened my perspective, allowing me to explore the intersections between science and its socio-political context.

Feel free to explore my site and learn more about my work and interests.
