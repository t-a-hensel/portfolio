Hey, I’m Thomas, and you found my academic portfolio.

I pursue a PhD in physics at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de) in Göttingen and at [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en). As a member of [Stefan Hell's](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de/hell) group, I focus on developing innovative methods for sub-diffraction scale microscopy.

Feel free to explore my site and learn more about my work and interests.
